Shinytest example package
=========================

This is an example R package which uses [shinytest](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest) to test two types of applications:

* An application which is in inst/sampleapp/app.R.
* An application which is created by a function, `helloWorldApp()`, instead of being in an app.R or ui.R/server.R.

For more information, see https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/package.html.
